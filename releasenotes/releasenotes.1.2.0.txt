There have been some changes in version 1.2.0 for custom configuration files making updates a little bit easier.

Until version 1.2.0 custom configuration files, like cert.txt and key.txt for SSL configuration, were located directly in /conf.
With version 1.2.0 all custom files have been moved to /conf/custom. Thus, if you have one of the custom files configured, you need to
move them to /conf/custom and change your application.conf accordingly. 

This has the advantage that you can backup your application.conf and the complete /custom folder before installation a new version. 
After installing the new version you can simple paste backup of application.conf and your /custom folder back to /conf.

Also the sorting of the users has been changed. The users are now sorted after points, correct results, correct differences, correct trends and
correct extra tips.

If you are on Windows I have good news. I found a way to start and stop Rudeltippen without psexec.exe from PSTools. 
Just run "rudeltippen.vbs /start" to start Rudeltippen or "rudeltippen.vbs /stop" to stop Rudeltippen.
